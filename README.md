# ValidateTable
Selenium Testing to validate whether 2 tables are the same 

Note: Chrome driver is placed in a seperate folder (ChromeDriver) and path is configured as such to use in code

Assumptions Made:
  1. To check whether 2 tables are the same, table data was validated
  2. Assertions packages etc were not to be used as instructions did not indicate as such

The following validations were done:
  1. Column Count
  2. Row Count
  3. Header Value Validation
  4. Table Data Validation
